### Monit Script - delayed_job - Ubuntu 9.10 Server
### This assumes your application is deployed using Capistrano, to the directory '/srv/www/app'
### Note: This uses a forked version of the delayed_job plugin which includes a script to daemonize delayed_job and creates a PID file that can be used for monitoring - http://github.com/collectiveidea/delayed_job

check process delayed_job with pidfile /srv/www/app/shared/pids/delayed_job.pid
  start program = "/usr/bin/env PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin /usr/bin/env RAILS_ENV=production /srv/www/app/current/script/delayed_job start"
  stop program = "/usr/bin/env PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin /usr/bin/env RAILS_ENV=production /srv/www/app/current/script/delayed_job stop"
